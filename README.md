# ðŸ“¦ Object-oriented-programming
## Objectives
- To demonstrate the differences between traditional imperative design and object-oriented design.
- To explain class structures as fundamental, modular building blocks.
- To understand the role of inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding and generic structures in building reusable code.
- To explain and to use defensive programming strategies, employing formal assertions and exception handling.
- To write small/medium scale C++ programs using **Qt framework**.
- To use classes written by other programmers when constructing their systems. 

## Assignments
- [Assignment1](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-assignment1) - getting used to C programming language by solving short problem statements.
- [Assignment2](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-assignment2) - implemented a C console-based application to manage the offers for a tourism agency, using **modular programming**, **layered architecture**, a **dynamically allocated array**, **specifications** and **tests**, **input validation** methods, while avoiding any **memory leaks**.
- [Assignment3](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-assignment3) - implemented a GUI C++ application that manages the events in a town, from an administrator perspective, as well as from an user perspective, using **layered architecture**, **specifications** and **tests**, **custom exceptions**, **input validation** methods, **persistent storage using file-based repositories**, **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, **smart pointers**, **QT framework**.

## Exams
- [Exam1](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-exam1) - implemented a console-based application that simulates the transactions for a real estate agency, using **inheritance**, **polymorphism** and an **UML diagram** as a starting point.
- [Exam2](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-exam2) - implemented a QT GUI application which helps astronomers catalogue stars and graphically visualize them.

## Other projects
- [Chat](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-extra1) - implemented a QT GUI chat application that works between multiple local users, using the **Observer design pattern**.
- [Quiz](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-extra2) - implemented a QT GUI application which simulates a quiz game between multiple users.
- [Q&A](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-extra3) - implemented a QT GUI application which mimics a basic version of Stack Overflow.
- [Screenwriting](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-extra4) - implemented a QT GUI application which simulates the writing of an episode by multiple screenwriters.
