# Object-oriented-programming
## Objectives
- To demonstrate the differences between traditional imperative design and object-oriented design.
- To explain class structures as fundamental, modular building blocks.
- To understand the role of inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding and generic structures in building reusable code.
- To explain and to use defensive programming strategies, employing formal assertions and exception handling.
- To write small/medium scale C++ programs using **Qt framework**.
- To use classes written by other programmers when constructing their systems. 

## Assignments
- [Assignment1](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-assignment1) - getting used to C programming language by solving short problem statements.
- [Assignment2](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/object-oriented-programming-assignment2) - implemented a C console-based application to manage the offers for a tourism agency, using **modular programming**, **layered architecture**, a **dynamically allocated array**, **specifications** and **tests**, **input validation** methods, while avoiding any **memory leaks**.
